# KimiShop-XSS
This repository contains an example of a web site vulnerable to the XSS attack and implements a solution through the control of input fields. 

The Frontend is developed in HTML and JavaScript, using Bootsrap to create a responsive site.

The backend is developed with NodeJS, using Express component implementing MVC and MongoDB.

Express (creates routes, receives and handles petitions):
     - "npm install express"

BodyParser (converts petitions to JSON Object): 
    - "npm install body-parser "

Moongose (connect MongoDB form NodeJS)
    - "npm mongoose"

Nodemon (automatic refreshes changes in the NodeJS server)
    - "npm nodemon"
